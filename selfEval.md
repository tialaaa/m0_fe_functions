# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
```
I definitely want to work on my time management and estimation. This week I've noticed that most things take longer than I initially estimate, which pushes the whole day longer and longer. Even though I know I need give myself breaks throughout the day, I have already fallen into the thought pattern of "Let me just finish this one more thing, I'm so close" and then I'm still there an hour later. By the end of yesterday's work on For statements, by brain was completely spent because I did not take enough breaks. Today I've started using an online Pomodoro timer for a reminder that I can't ignore.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
```
A function is set of rules that you can make up to tell something or someone what to do. After you make those rules, they can be reused for other things or people too.
```

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
```
Parameters are variables in the function definition. Arguments are data types in the function call. The number of arguments must match the number of parameters declared.
```

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?
```
I'm curious to see how everyone completed Functions problem #4. That problem seems like it could be solved multiple ways and it would be enlightening to see how other people solved it.
